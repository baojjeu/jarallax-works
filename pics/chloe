Hi 혜진, I'm Baozi.
Do you know what day it is today?
Well, if you don't, please let me tell you.

Today is a big day. Ha ha.
The reason why that there is a special girl who was born in the world!
She is awesome, especially her courage, she told me she will go to Canada for working holiday alone!
I found out that her star sign is Sagittarius.
Sagittarius stands for challenges, freedom and positive.
No wonder she is so brave.

I really want to be her best friend as soon as I meet her.
Although we have not seen each other in the real world.

I'm affected by her, she lets me know I can do what I want exactly.
I'm grateful for her, I'm following my dream now, and no worries.

8 months later, she will fly there to design and enjoy her wonderful life.
30 months later, I will jump there to follow in her footprints and create my pretty life.
I'm looking forward to doing that.

Hope one day we can be a good partner and travel whole world around.
Umm...she is your friend, right?
Now I would like to ask a favor of you!
Could you take a messages? Thank you!

Alright, I'm serious.
Can you accept my request?
